                <h2 style="color: green;">The Benefits of Having Indoor Plants</h2>

                <p>Many houseplants absorb toxic substances such as formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene, found in man-made materials that are known to "off-gas" pollutants into the air in your home, school, and office. In addition, a study done at Virginia Tech led researchers to conclude that houseplants can reduce indoor dust by up to 20%. In effect, houseplants are efficient air cleaners.</p>
                
                <p>NASA has done extensive studies of the role of houseplants in cleansing the air, hoping to capitalize on these benefits for future space stations. Their studies have shown that certain houseplants are exceptionally good at cleansing the air (click to see NASAâ€™s houseplant list).</p>
                
                <p>NASA recommends having 15-18 houseplants for a 1,800-square-foot house. While not all of us have room for quite that many plants, even just a few can be effective. Dr. Virginia Lohr, a professor of horticulture at Washington State University, suggests that filling as little as 2% of the room with plants will make an impact.</p>
